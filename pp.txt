⭐ What is Test Function (In Project Context)?

👉 A Test Function is used to verify that:

Data is correct

Pipelines are working

Transformations are correct

KPIs are calculated correctly

In Data Engineering, this usually means:

Data Quality Tests

Pipeline Tests

Transformation Validation

Business Logic Validation

⭐ Simple Definition (Interview Safe)

“A test function is used to validate data accuracy, pipeline execution, and transformation correctness to ensure reliable analytics output.”

⭐ Types of Testing in Your Project (Very Important)
✅ 1. Data Quality Testing

Check:

Null values

Duplicate records

Wrong formats

Missing columns

Example:

Attendance cannot be NULL

Waste weight cannot be negative

✅ 2. Pipeline Testing

Check:

Did pipeline run successfully?

Did data load to correct table?

Did all steps complete?

✅ 3. Transformation Testing

Check:

JSON parsed correctly

Device mapped to correct kitchen zone

Waste event created correctly

✅ 4. Business KPI Testing

Check:

Waste calculations correct

Overproduction formula correct

Cost calculations correct

⭐ Test Function Examples (Concept Level)
🟢 Example 1 — Waste Weight Validation

Test Rule:

Waste Weight >= 0


Why:
Waste cannot be negative.

🟢 Example 2 — Attendance Validation

Test Rule:

Employee ID NOT NULL
Date NOT NULL

🟢 Example 3 — IoT JSON Validation

Test:

Device ID exists

Timestamp valid

Weight exists

⭐ Example Python Test Function (Simple)
def validate_waste_weight(weight):
    if weight < 0:
        return "Invalid Waste Value"
    return "Valid"

⭐ Example SQL Test Query
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fact_waste_event
WHERE waste_weight < 0;


If count > 0 → Data issue.

⭐ What You Can Write in Your Design / Test Section

You can say:

Testing Strategy

Data quality validation using SQL checks

Pipeline validation using ADF monitoring

Transformation validation using Databricks test queries

KPI validation using reconciliation reports

⭐ Real Testing Tools (If Panel Asks)

You can mention:

SQL validation queries

PySpark validation scripts

ADF pipeline monitoring

Databricks notebooks testing

(You don’t need advanced testing tools for this project.)
